kódigó: [noun] code • cheat sheet • crib note

I studied Japanese language for around 2 years by myself. I used a lot of resources like Genki I & II, Udemy Online Japanese Course, Tae Kim's Guide to Japanese Grammar, etc.. but still failed JLPT N4 examination last December 2019.

I am still learning N4 and my goal is to reach at least N3 level. I will be updating this cheat sheet regularly when I am reviewing or learning any vocabulary, kanji or grammar.

Update February 10, 2021:

I have completed studying N4 and currently reviewing. I will be soon starting N3 and looking forward to reach N2.
